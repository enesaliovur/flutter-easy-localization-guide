# 🌍 Easy Localization Flutter Project

This project demonstrates how to implement multilingual support in a Flutter application using the Easy Localization package. The app supports multiple languages and allows users to switch between them at runtime. It also uses a custom AppLocalizationManager to manage localization operations efficiently.

# 🛠️ Features

🚀 Easy Initialization: Simple setup for initializing localization files.

🔄 Dynamic Language Switching: Change the app's locale dynamically using a custom manager class.

🏗️ Clean Architecture: Organized project structure with support for localization files, keys, and translations.

## 🛠️ Generate `locale_keys.g.dart`

To generate the `locale_keys.g.dart` file, you can simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh scripts/lang.sh
```
